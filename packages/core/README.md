```

### Using SVGs

Hereâ€™s how you can integrate the SVGs into your project:

```js
import { tokensBrandedETH } from '@token-icons/core'

function EthIcon() {
  // Using an img tag
  return <img src={tokensBrandedETH} alt="Ethereum Icon" />
  // Or, inserting SVG directly
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: tokensBrandedETH }} />
}
```

## Token Metadata

The `@token-icons/core` package also provides comprehensive metadata for each cryptocurrency token in a convenient JSON format, which you can import directly into your project.

import { tokens, networks } from '@token-icons/core/metadata'
```

## Tree-shaking

`@token-icons/core` is designed to be tree-shaken, meaning that it only includes the SVGs that are actually used in your project. This can help reduce the size of your bundle and improve performance. Just import the icons you only need.
